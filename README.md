# Flowinone — Unified Visual Knowledge Hub

Flowinone brings every visual collection you care about into a single, elegant interface:

- **Local media libraries** (NAS, external drives, internal assets)
- **Eagle App** folders, tags, and items via its API
- **Chrome bookmarks**, including auto-generated thumbnail walls for YouTube links

Add an AI-style discovery homepage, three browsing modes (grid / single / vertical strip), a built-in video player, and one-click Finder/Explorer shortcuts, and you get far more than bookmark management—it’s a full visual knowledge hub.

## 🔥 Highlights

- **Eagle Explorer**: Real-time access to Eagle folders, tags, and items. The home page curates newly-added and trending collections automatically.
- **Multi-source browsing**: Local disks, Eagle, Chrome bookmarks, and YouTube videos all surface in the same UI with quick view switching (Grid / Single / Linear).
- **Chrome + YouTube integration**:
  - Navigate the entire bookmark tree.
  - A dedicated YouTube page gathers every saved video and displays rich thumbnails.
- **Smart discovery**: The landing page offers random inspiration, video highlights, folder spotlights, popular tags, and AI-style similar clusters.
- **Thoughtful interactions**:
  - Bookmarks and YouTube links open in new tabs.
  - Local and Eagle videos play in the built-in viewer.
  - Finder/Explorer shortcuts jump straight to the real file system path.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-name/flowinone.git
cd flowinone
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment & install deps
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt   # or install Flask, requests, pandas manually for now
```

> Current dependencies are lightweight (Flask + requests/pandas for Eagle API). Adjust `requirements.txt` to match your environment.

### 3. Configure paths
Edit `config.py` and set:
- `DB_route_external`: root of your external / primary media library
- `DB_route_internal`: staging or internal media path
- `CHROME_BOOKMARK_PATH`: Chrome bookmark JSON (default is macOS path; update for Windows/Linux)

### 4. Launch the app
```bash
python run.py
```
Visit `http://localhost:5894`.

## 🧭 Navigation Cheat Sheet

| Menu item | What you get |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Home** | Eagle-powered discovery feed (random inspiration, video highlights, hot tags, similar clusters) |
| **DB Main** | Local/external media folders with Grid / Single / Linear views |
| **Chrome Bookmarks** | Full Chrome bookmark hierarchy |
| **YouTube Bookmarks** | Every YouTube link rendered with thumbnails |
| **EAGLE Folders / Tags / Stream** | Browse Eagle folders, tags, and real-time item streams |

Every browsing page supports:
- Three view toggles (Grid / Single / Linear)
- Alphabetical sorting (A→Z / Z→A)
- Folder drill-down; bookmarks/videos open directly (new tab or built-in player)

## 🧩 Architecture at a Glance

- `run.py` — bootstraps the Flask app and registers all routes.
- `routes.py` — routing layer combining Eagle, file-system, and Chrome bookmark endpoints.
- `file_handler.py` — core logic:
  - Normalizes all media metadata (local + Eagle).
  - Parses Chrome bookmarks, detects YouTube URLs, and builds recommendations.
  - Powers the AI-style homepage feed.
- `templates/` — Jinja2 templates, with `view_both.html` providing the three-view UI.
- `書籤瀏覽器_youtube專用/` — original YouTube bookmark scripts kept for reference (now integrated).

## 🛣️ Roadmap & Ideas

- [ ] Publish `requirements.txt` and a Dockerfile for painless deployment.
- [ ] Feed face-recognition results into Eagle metadata (auto “main character” tags).
- [ ] Deeper AI clustering (color palettes, subjects, layouts).
- [ ] Optional auth / remote access (currently optimized for LAN usage).

PRs and issues are very welcome—let’s make Flowinone even better together!
